    "## Ilastik for 10/31/16 Week\n",
    "From last week, I was able to generate 3D TIFF slices and image classifiers on Fear199 downsampled data.  However, my problems were that:  \n",
    "1)  The TIFF slices were odd, cigar-shaped tubes.  \n",
    "2)  I was unable to generate a significant classifier using the existing data because of the weird image layout.  \n",
    "3)  I had trouble loading in the TIFF stack despite having generated one via ImageJ  \n",
    "\n",
    "What I did this week was:  \n",
    "1)  Figure out why my original data was the odd cigar-shaped data.    \n",
    "2)  Correctly generate a subset of TIFF slices for Fear199.   \n",
    "3)  Generate a pixel-based object classifier.  \n",

    "What I need help with/still need to learn:  \n",
    "1)  How to interpret/better validate my classifier results (currently have hdf5/TIFF output, how can I validate this?)  \n",

After running the object classifier on the new TIFF slice in both cases, my TIFF version of the probability map is completely black.  Evidently, this indicates one of two problems:  \n",

    "    \n",
    "An obvious workaround would be loading the new data inside the batch predictions menu built into Ilastik.  I spent time trying to do so, but I ran into some odd challenges.  When I loaded the individual TIFF slices, they're obviously the wrong dimensions (since they're each x-y-greyscale, while the classifier takes z-y-x-greyscale).  When I created a TIFF stack, Ilastik threw a completely mysterious error (that, after Googling, seems to be resolved by redownloading an older version of Ilastik).  I tried to do this, but that didn't work - the issue still happens to be open on their Github page."
